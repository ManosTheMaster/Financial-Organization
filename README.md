## M.Organ
This project helps you organize your costs makes your life easier when provides you a complete picture of your expenses.

## Motivation
I always had the need to analyze what I'm doing to help myself evolve later in my life. I just wanted to express my experience somehow with numbers.
This program does this by "tracking" the flow of money I spend. I know the position and the level of mood I was in a particular time period, simply by noting my cost.

## Code style
I try to write "Clean Code", but it's not as I would like to be.
Surely you will understand it if you read it because it is full of many good informative comments
